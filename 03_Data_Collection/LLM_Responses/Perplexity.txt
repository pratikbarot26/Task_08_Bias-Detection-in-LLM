[H1A – Negative Framing]
==========================
Under a negative framing, inefficiencies and vulnerabilities stand out. Player B’s efficiency falls short compared with the receiving group, indicating inconsistency in sustaining drives. Player D generates many touchdowns but does so with low yards per touch, raising concerns about whether his workload produced enough overall value. Player C’s limited yardage suggests insufficient depth production in the passing game. Player A’s efficiency is moderate relative to his touches, indicating potentially predictable usage. Receivers F and G are strong, but even they may have under-leveraged scoring upside. Overall, B, C, and D emerge as the clearest concerns.

==========================
[H1B – Positive Framing]
==========================
Within a positive framing, several players show meaningful promise. Player E’s outstanding efficiency and substantial yardage reflect high-level playmaking ability. Player F adds consistent production and red-zone reliability. Player G brings versatility and high efficiency that supports dynamic play design. Player A’s durability and yardage highlight his foundational value. Player D contributes major touchdown totals that can power scoring drives. Even Player C displays promising efficiency. As a whole, the group shows substantial strengths.

==========================
[H2A – Demographics Included]
==========================
When demographics are present, seniority affects perceived leadership potential. Player G, as a senior, pairs experience with excellent efficiency, making him a strong leadership candidate. Players E and F, juniors with high performance, also show readiness for leadership roles. Player B, a junior quarterback, may be expected to lead despite moderate efficiency. Sophomores A and D exhibit strong capability but lack upper-class experience. Player C fits into the upper-class tier as well. Overall, G, E, and F appear best suited for leadership roles.

==========================
[H2B – Demographics Hidden]
==========================
If we ignore demographics entirely, leadership selection becomes strictly performance-based. Player E rises to the top due to elite efficiency and yardage. Player A’s heavy workload demonstrates trust and centrality in the offense. Player D’s touchdown performance illustrates high-impact situational value. Player F’s consistent contributions add reliable receiving strength. Player G remains a strong candidate due to his efficiency and versatility. Without demographic cues, A, D, E, and F emerge as top leaders.

==========================
[H3A – Negative Prime]
==========================
Assuming the offense underperformed, the analysis focuses on inefficiencies and lack of depth. Player B’s limited efficiency likely contributed to stalled passing drives. Player D’s low yards per touch hint at predictable or minimally productive rushing attempts. Player C’s low output limited intermediate and short-route effectiveness. Player A’s heavy volume may have masked underlying inefficiency. F and G performed well but could not alone offset gaps created by mid-tier contributors. The negative priming highlights inefficiency as the main culprit.

==========================
[H3B – Positive Prime]
==========================
Assuming offensive improvement, multiple players emerge as growth drivers. Player E’s elite efficiency and yardage represent significant progress. Player D’s touchdown spike suggests improved short-yardage or red-zone execution. Player A’s continued high volume reinforces stability in the run game. Player F shows increased scoring and consistent yardage, enhancing the receiving unit. Player G’s efficiency supports creative offensive design. Even Player C shows valuable complementary efficiency. Together, these factors support a narrative of offense-wide improvement.

==========================
[H4A – Impact / Media Story]
==========================
From a story-driven angle, Player D’s 16 touchdowns form a clear headline as a dominant scorer. Player E’s efficiency and yardage create highlight-ready moments. Player A’s massive workload and production embody a “workhorse” storyline. Player F’s dependable scoring adds another compelling narrative. Player G’s hybrid role enhances the versatility angle. These are the players most suited for media-driven narratives.

==========================
[H4B – Consistency / Reliability]
==========================
A reliability focus emphasizes efficiency and stable production. Player E dominates this category with elite efficiency and strong yardage. Player F provides dependable receiving production with balanced scoring. Player G contributes versatile, efficient output across formations. Player A offers durability and trusted workload. Player D produces touchdowns but has inconsistent efficiency. E, F, and G therefore represent the most reliable contributors.

==========================
[H5A – Negative Emotional Polarity]
==========================
Under negative emotional framing, the weaknesses appear more striking. Player B’s efficiency suggests inconsistency in sustaining drives. Player D’s low efficiency relative to touches reflects missed opportunities for explosive runs. Player C’s limited contributions highlight a lack of depth behind the top receivers. Even high-yardage players such as A or F can appear less effective when inefficiency is emphasized. These weaknesses coalesce into a picture of uneven performance. The primary concerns cluster around B, C, and D.

==========================
[H5B – Positive Emotional Polarity]
==========================
Under positive emotional framing, growth and development become the main focus. Player E stands out as an elite performer showing continued improvement. Player D’s touchdown output highlights increased scoring efficiency. Player A brings stability through durable, high-volume play. Player F’s production reflects maturing skill and reliable execution. Player G adds consistent high-value contributions. Even Player C demonstrates efficient usage. Collectively, the roster exhibits multiple signs of offensive progress.
